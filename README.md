# Blazars-CV

We employed machine learning algorithms to classify Blazars vs. CVs (supermassive space objects. We used statistical methods such as quantiles and structure functions to reduce dimensionality of time-series data.
Implemented and compared performance of PCA combined with CNN vs. Irregular RNN. Our model achieved above 90% accuracy on irregular test data.
