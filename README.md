# Blazars vs. CVs

We employed machine learning algorithms to classify Blazars vs. CVs (supermassive space objects). Statistical methods such as quantiles and structure functions were used to reduce dimensionality of time-series data. We implemented and compared performance of PCA combined with CNN vs. Irregular RNN, and our model achieved above 90% accuracy on irregular test data.
